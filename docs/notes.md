Questions:

* To be able to build a DB container must be running for jOOQ generation to happen. Did some googling and could not find anything that says jOOQ can handle it offline. Is this a bad thing?
* tomcat folder + another folder (app/hsperfdata_root/) is being created with every start. What to do about it?
